Run the game using TetrisGui.java
Final version of program including the following 4 class:
1) PreviewHelpPanel
2) BoardPanel
3) TetrisGui

These are in view package. If there are any other files, please ignore them. I don't know whether the old file will be
deleted from SVN if the latest version of program already get rid of it before committing. Another the way is using 
the zip file from submission.

model Board was changed (comments are in it) to add autostep method.
